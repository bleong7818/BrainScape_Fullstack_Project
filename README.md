# README

This is an [example link](https://flash-of-brilliance.herokuapp.com/#/).

Flash of Brilliance is a flashcard website for people dedicated to learning and improvement. Users can log in, sign up, and log out from their user page. There is also a deck show page for existing decks. 

On the technical side, Flash of Brilliance is a an application that uses Rails and React. Rails makes up the backend for the project while the front end follows the react-redux cycle, including ajax calls, actions, reducers, and components. 

These the specs and instructions for the app.

Ruby version: 2.5.1

Rails version: 5.2.4.4

**Instructions for using the app from Terminal

* Run Rails 

**Future Additions for the Project

* Full CRUD methods for flashcard decks and flashcards will be accessible by logged in users.
* Logged in users will also be able to study flashcard decks.
* Non-logged in users will be able to navigate the site and see flashcard decks, but will be unable to study them.
* A search feature will be added in order to find decks by subject.
* There may be a public user page added that shows the decks that a user has made, but that is TBD.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
